# Title: COMMUNITY DETECTION PROBLEM FOR AN ACADEMIC NETWORK

## Abstract
In this paper, three algorithms to detect communities in social networks were studied. The Ùè∞Årst, proposed by Clauset, Newman and Moore (known by the initials of the creators, CNM), is based on the optimization of the quality measure called modularity. The second one, Wakita algorithm, is based on the algorithm CNM, but proposes an improvement of the same; this algorithm uses a consolidation rate that takes into account the size of communities and leads to a balanced growth between the communities, so it is more appropriate for larger networks. The third algorithm, known as Blondel, also uses the modularity, and works in two steps, so you can work in suitable time with larger networks.

From this study, an experiment was performed with real data obtained with the second year students of the basic course of the IME. Two graphs containing information provided by students during the years 2011 were molded to analyze the formation of groups using the CNM algorithm and were compared with each other about the formation of these groups.

As a product of this experiment, a site was created to automatically generate graphs from actual information obtained in the form. The graph produced was created in com- pliance with the conditions of the entry for the CNM algorithm.
